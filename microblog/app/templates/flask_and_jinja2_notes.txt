jinja2 replaces placeholders captured in {{ }} and control statements 
captured in {% %}.  Control statements include if/else/endif and for/endfor. 
These represent parts of the page that are variable and will only be known at runtime 

Jinja2 has a template inheritance feature. The block control statement 
defines the place where the derived templates can insert themselves. Blocks are given a 
unique name, which derived templates can reference when they provide their content. 
The extends statement establishes the inheritance link between  two templates
